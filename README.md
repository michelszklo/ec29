# README for Replication Materials "Does Increasing Public Spending in Health Improve Health? Lessons from a Constitutional Reform in Brazil" (Clarke, Rocha, Szklo)

This folder contains principal replication materials for the paper **Does Increasing Public Spending in Health Improve Health? Lessons from a Constitutional Reform in Brazil**.  These materials are in progress.

These materials are the source folder of a larger directory structured as follows:
    
```
    ├── README.md
    ├── source
    ├── data
    │   ├── raw
    │   ├── processed
    ├── results
    │   ├── tables
    │   ├── figures
```

At present, scripts are being re-structured, but principal figures and tables can be generated with the following steps:

1. Run the script `08_regs_vars_specs.R` to generate estimation functions
2. Run the script `RUN_reduced_form_graphs.R` to export and output main plots.
